[{"id":"44fc2b35-ffc0-4d41-bf59-2bad9ae3e550","question":"How does React?","answer":"React is a library that allows you to write JavaScript components. It uses a syntax similar to XML, and the markup of the components is a mix between HTML and XML. It uses a technology called the “Virtual DOM” to manage updates. Virtual DOM is just another way of saying a big object with all the components rendered on the page and their properties. Whenever one of them changes, React knows what to do. For event handling, React registers a global event handler (on the HTML or Body element) and whenever events come through that listener, it takes on the responsibility to propagate the proper events and trigger the right handlers within components further down the chain.","image":"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/arrowhitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/01031030/ReactJS.png"},
{"id":"e2b05e73-c653-40af-a5cc-d90b69bda5e6","question":"Difference between State and Props in ReactJs","answer":"React is an opensource JavaScript library that offers a visual overview of the JavaScript architecture for conventional MVC. React promises programmers a model in which substrates cannot directly influence enclosing components—data are downstream, data changes in HTML are efficiently modified, and the DOM is abstracted to boost performance using Virtual DOM. How can we access data from the previous component if the data is just being flowed from components to components? The answer is props. React uses data transmission props that we need to transfer to various components. The difference comes in which component the data are owned. State is owned locally and the component itself updates it. Props are owned and read-only by a parent. Props can be changed only if an upstream shift is caused by a callback function passed on to the child. A prop can be passed on to the child in the state of a parent. They apply to the same value but can only be updated by the parent variable.","image":"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/arrowhitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/07082528/off-feature-2-1024x576.jpg"},

It helps reduce the clutter of the component lifecycle methods and, most importantly, it helps separate different logic that can appear in the lifecycle methods. By default, useEffect always runs after the first render. The dependency array in useEffect lets you specify the conditions to trigger it. If you provide useEffect an empty dependency array, it'll run exactly once. We use useEffect() when our content need to be updated, for that cases we should use dependency in useEffect().","image":"https://daveceddia.com/images/useEffect-hook.png"},
